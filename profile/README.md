# 🐌✨Mollu Design

> **Steady by design.**

Mollu Design builds developer tools inspired by the quiet resilience of the snail —  
where every line of code is a deliberate step forward, and every interface feels like a safe shell.

We reject rushed interfaces and noisy animations. Instead, we offer **clarity, consistency, and calm confidence**.
